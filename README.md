**Introduction**
Even though many climbers lost their lives on Everest expeditions, the statistic has been growing over time. Therefore, I have investigated safety issues, such as mortality rates and the effects of the host, in addition to revealing key historical trends in Everest climbing, such as variations in the number of climbers, the seasons, and demographics like age and gender. This study's dataset, which covers Everest expeditions from 1953 until 2020, was obtained via Kaggle [1]. With a beKer understanding of Everest expeditions, climbers, organizations, and researchers will be able to plan safer and more productive ascents.

After an extensive exploration of diverse modelling techniques—from linear and nonlinear regression to sophisticated methods like general additive models (GAM), tree-based approaches, and logistic regression—I've selected two primary models that best align with my dataset: the general additive model and logistic regression model. These choices are grounded in their superior compatibility with the dataset's characteristics and their exceptional predictive capacity for forecasting future expeditions. In addition, I have utilized a variety of statistical techniques, including means, regression analyses, correlation studies, variance assessments, and more. I hope to provide a thorough examination of expedition data over a range of time periods by utilizing these statistical tools and prediction models. This is not only a retrospective analysis, but it also provides important estimates for various variables related to Everest expeditions. In light of upcoming Everest expeditions, these projections offer insighXul information that will facilitate improved strategic planning and decision-making.

I started researching Everest trips and discovered a fascinating—and sometimes depressing—story. Although the numbers showed a steady increase in the number of trips over time, they also highlighted the tragic deaths of climbers on these journeys. This led me to investigate the nuances of safety in more detail, paying close aKention to death rates and the unique impact of host nations on these missions. I investigated the paKerns that shape these expeditions, like the different climbers' participation rates and the seasons that have significant effects on these challenging climbs. Examining demographic factors such as the age and gender distribution of climbers provided additional perspectives on the dynamics of the expedition.

With the intention of guiding climbers, organizations, and researchers alike, it aimed to offer a comprehensive overview of Everest expeditions. This more profound understanding may provide useful direction for future ascents to Everest, making ascents safer and more effective.
